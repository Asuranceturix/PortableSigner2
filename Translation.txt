If you want to translate PortableSigner in your own language:

Translation of the User Interface:
- copy i18n.properties to i18n_xx.properties where xx is your two letter
    language code.
- edit i18n_xx.properties and translate the strings in the file.
- I'm using the build in language detection in Java. So the program should
    come up with the correct settings.
- you can test different languages with:
    LC_ALL=xx java  -jar PortableSigner.jar
    where xx is your language code.

Translation of the signature block:
- open the file Signatureblock.properties for editing
- create new entries starting with x- where x is the next number in the file:
    1 = english
    2 = german
    3 = polish
    4 = ....
- translate the entries in the file
- In i18n*.properties (every file!) is an entry in the form of:
    SignatureLanguages=english,german,polish
    Add your language here!
- In SignCommandLine.java look for:
    "// add your language on the next line =>"
    add your language after this line like the other languages
